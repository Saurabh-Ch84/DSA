Explain the following text primarily based on the surrounding page content: Given an array of unique integers numbers, your task is to find the number of pairs of indices (i, j) such that i ≤ j and the sum numbers[i] + numbers[j] is equal to some power of 2. Note: The numbers 20 = 1, 21 = 2, 22 = 4, 23 = 8, etc. are considered to be powers of 2.

Absolutely, Saurabh! Here's a concise breakdown of each technical concept from the VISA Inc. interview experience:

---

### üèóÔ∏è System Design

- **Horizontal vs Vertical Scaling**  
  - *Horizontal*: Add more machines (scale out).  
  - *Vertical*: Upgrade existing machine‚Äôs resources (scale up).

- **IRCTC Ticket Booking Synchronization**  
  - Use a **centralized database** or **distributed locking** (e.g., Redis, Zookeeper) to prevent double booking.  
  - Ensure atomic transactions and consistency across locations.

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems

- **Process vs Thread**  
  - *Process*: Independent unit with separate memory.  
  - *Thread*: Lightweight unit within a process, shares memory.

- **Semaphores (with Example)**  
  - Used for synchronization.  
  - *Example*: A binary semaphore controlling access to a single printer‚Äîonly one thread can print at a time.

### üåê Security

- **DDoS Attack**  
  - *Distributed Denial of Service*: Multiple systems flood a target server with traffic, causing service disruption.

### üìò Theory Concepts

#### **1. What is Testing and Types of Testing**
- **Testing**: Process of evaluating a system to identify defects and ensure it meets requirements.
- **Types**:
  - *Unit Testing*: Tests individual components.
  - *Integration Testing*: Tests interaction between modules.
  - *System Testing*: Tests the complete system.
  - *Acceptance Testing*: Validates against business requirements.
  - *Regression Testing*: Ensures new changes don‚Äôt break existing functionality.

#### **2. Stages of SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**
1. **Requirement Analysis**
2. **System Design**
3. **Implementation (Coding)**
4. **Testing**
5. **Deployment**
6. **Maintenance**

Each stage ensures structured development and delivery of software.

#### **3. Semaphores**
- A **semaphore** is a synchronization primitive used to control access to shared resources.
- **Example**: A counting semaphore with value 3 allows up to 3 threads to access a resource simultaneously.
 When a thread finishes, it signals (increments) the semaphore.

### üß† Puzzles

#### **1. 3 Equilateral Triangles with 6 Matchsticks**
- **Solution**: Form a **triangular pyramid (tetrahedron)**.
  - Use 3 matchsticks to form a base triangle.
  - Use the remaining 3 to connect each vertex of the base to a single top point.
  - This creates 3 equilateral triangles on the sides.

#### **2. Hourglass Puzzle**
- **Goal**: Measure exactly 9 minutes using a 4-minute and 7-minute hourglass.
- **Steps**:
  1. Start both hourglasses.
  2. At 4 mins: Flip the 4-min hourglass.
  3. At 7 mins: Flip the 7-min hourglass.
  4. At 8 mins: Flip the 4-min again.
  5. At 9 mins: The 7-min hourglass finishes‚Äî**exactly 9 minutes measured**.

### 🗃️ **Types of Databases & Examples**
- **Relational Databases**: Store data in tables with predefined schemas.  
  - *Examples*: MySQL, PostgreSQL  
- **NoSQL Databases**: Handle unstructured or semi-structured data, often schema-less.  
  - *Examples*: MongoDB, Cassandra

### ✅ **ACID Properties**
These ensure reliable transactions in databases:
- **Atomicity**: All operations in a transaction succeed or none do.
- **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state before and after the transaction.
- **Isolation**: Concurrent transactions don’t interfere with each other.
- **Durability**: Once committed, changes persist even after system failure.

### 🧮 **Normalization Types & Examples**
Normalization reduces redundancy and improves data integrity:
- **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Eliminate repeating groups.  
  - *Example*: Split multiple phone numbers into separate rows.
- **2NF**: Remove partial dependencies (non-key attributes depend on full primary key).
- **3NF**: Remove transitive dependencies (non-key attributes depend only on the key).
- **BCNF**: Stronger version of 3NF, every determinant is a candidate key.

### 🌐 **OSI Model Layers & Functions**
The OSI model has 7 layers:
1. **Physical** – Transmits raw bits over a medium.
2. **Data Link** – Handles error detection and framing.
3. **Network** – Routes packets (IP).
4. **Transport** – Ensures reliable delivery (TCP).
5. **Session** – Manages sessions between applications.
6. **Presentation** – Translates data formats (encryption, compression).
7. **Application** – Interfaces with end-user applications (HTTP, FTP).

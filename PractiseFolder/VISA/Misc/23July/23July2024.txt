Awesome! Let’s turn that “water bottle software” prompt into a reusable interview toolkit.
Here's how you can structure it with diagrams and use cases:
---

### 🧪 Step 1: Use Case Model

Let’s define what the “smart water bottle” might do. Think of it as a bottle with sensors, 
Bluetooth, and maybe a mobile app.

#### 👤 Actors
- **User**: Drinks water, checks hydration stats
- **System**: Tracks water intake, sends reminders
- **Admin** (optional): Updates firmware, manages settings

#### 📌 Use Cases
| Use Case              | Description                                      |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Log Water Intake      | Automatically or manually record consumption     |
| Set Hydration Goal    | User sets daily target (e.g., 2L/day)            |
| Send Reminder         | Notify user to drink water at intervals          |
| Sync with App         | Transfer data to mobile app                      |
| Battery Monitoring    | Alert when battery is low                        |
| Temperature Display   | Show current water temperature                   |

### 🧱 Step 2: Class Diagram (Simplified)

```plaintext
+------------------+
|   WaterBottle    |
+------------------+
| - capacity       |
| - currentLevel   |
| - temperature    |
| - batteryLevel   |
+------------------+
| +logIntake()     |
| +sendReminder()  |
| +syncData()      |
+------------------+

        ▲
        |
+------------------+
|     Sensor       |
+------------------+
| - type           |
| - value          |
+------------------+
| +readData()      |
+------------------+

        ▲
        |
+------------------+
|     App          |
+------------------+
| - userProfile    |
| - hydrationGoal  |
+------------------+
| +displayStats()  |
| +updateGoal()    |
+------------------+
```

### 🧠 Step 3: Software Quality Attributes

You nailed these in your interview. Here’s how they map to the design:

- **Modularity**: Separate classes for Bottle, Sensor, App
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns, easy to update
- **Compatibility**: Syncs with Android/iOS via Bluetooth
- **Scalability**: Can add features like voice reminders or gamification
- **Adaptability**: Handles requirement changes via Agile or MVP model

---

### 📋 Step 4: SRS Snapshot

**Functional Requirements**:
- Track water intake
- Set and monitor hydration goals
- Send reminders
- Sync with mobile app

**Non-Functional Requirements**:
- Should work offline
- Battery-efficient
- Secure data sync

---

### 🔐 **Security & Cryptography**

#### **Encoding vs Encryption vs Hashing**
- **Encoding**: Transforms data into a readable format (e.g., Base64). Not secure, reversible.
- **Encryption**: Secures data using keys. Reversible with correct key.
- **Hashing**: One-way transformation for integrity checks (e.g., SHA-256). Not reversible.

#### **Types of Encryption**
- **Symmetric Encryption**: Same key for encryption and decryption (e.g., AES, DES).
- **Asymmetric Encryption**: Uses public/private key pair (e.g., RSA). Public key encrypts, private key decrypts.

#### **Alice-Bob Example**
- Alice encrypts a message using Bob’s public key.
- Only Bob can decrypt it using his private key—ensuring confidentiality.

### 🌐 **Web Fundamentals**

#### **Is HTTP Stateless?**
Yes. HTTP doesn’t retain session info between requests.

#### **How Does It Manage User-Specific Content?**
Via:
- **Cookies**: Stored on client, sent with each request.
- **Sessions**: Server-side storage linked via session ID.
- **JWTs**: Encoded tokens with user info.

#### **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
A vulnerability where attackers inject malicious scripts into trusted websites.
- **Mitigation**: Input sanitization, escaping output, using CSP headers.

---

### 📱 **Mobile Development**

#### **Android Development**
- **Language**: Java
- **IDEs**: Eclipse, Android Studio

#### **iOS Development**
- **Language**: Swift or Objective-C
- **IDE**: Xcode

---

### 🧾 **Form Handling & HTTP Methods**

#### **Validations in Forms**
- **Client-side**: JavaScript checks (e.g., required fields, regex).
- **Server-side**: Backend validation for security and correctness.

#### **HTTP Methods**
- **GET**: Retrieves data; parameters in URL.
- **POST**: Sends data securely in body.
- **PUT**: Updates existing resource.
- **DELETE**: Removes resource.

#### **GET vs POST**
- **GET**: Limited URL size, less secure (data in URL).
- **POST**: Handles large payloads, more secure (data in body).

---

### 🧠 **Logic & Puzzles**

#### **Number of Threes from 1 to N**
Count how many times digit '3' appears across all numbers from 1 to N. Use digit-position analysis or brute force loop.

#### **Clock Puzzle: Minute & Hour Hand Overlaps in 24 Hours**
- **Correct Answer**: 22 times
- **Explanation**: Hands overlap every 65 minutes ≈ 11 times in 12 hours → 22 in 24 hours.

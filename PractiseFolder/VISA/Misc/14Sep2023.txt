These questions were asked during the **technical + HR round** of the **Visa Inc. summer internship interview**, as 
described on the GeeksforGeeks interview experience page. The interviewer had already reviewed the candidate‚Äôs resume 
and was probing their understanding of **database fundamentals**, especially in the context of their project work.

Here‚Äôs how each question fits into the surrounding context:

---

### üóÉÔ∏è **What is the difference between RDBMS and NoSQL databases?**
This question was aimed at testing the candidate‚Äôs grasp of **data modeling paradigms**:

- **RDBMS (Relational Database Management System)**:
  - Structured schema with tables, rows, and columns.
  - Uses SQL for querying.
  - Enforces ACID properties for consistency.
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

- **NoSQL**:
  - Schema-less or flexible schema.
  - Designed for scalability and high availability.
  - Supports key-value, document, column-family, or graph models.
  - Examples: MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis.

The interviewer likely wanted to see if the candidate could articulate **when and why** each model is used‚Äîe.g., 
RDBMS for transactional systems, NoSQL for large-scale distributed apps.

### ‚úÖ **Is there any benefit to using a SQL database?**
This follow-up question tested the candidate‚Äôs ability to **justify design choices**. Benefits of SQL databases include:

- Strong consistency and integrity via ACID compliance.
- Mature tooling and widespread community support.
- Powerful querying capabilities with joins and aggregations.
- Easier to enforce relationships and constraints.

The interviewer was likely probing whether the candidate had considered these advantages in their own project decisions.

### üîó **About Foreign Keys**
This question zoomed in on **relational integrity**:

- A **foreign key** is a constraint that links one table to another, ensuring that the referenced value exists.
- It enforces **referential integrity**, preventing orphan records.
- Example: In an `Orders` table, `customer_id` might be a foreign key referencing `Customers(id)`.

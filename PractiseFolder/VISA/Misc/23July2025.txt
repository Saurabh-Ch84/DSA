### 🧱 OOPS-Based Questions

The interviewer focused on core OOP principles, which are essential for writing modular, maintainable, and 
scalable code. Here's how the surrounding content frames these topics:

- **4 Pillars of OOP**:
  - **Encapsulation**: Bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (e.g., a class).
   It helps in hiding internal states and requiring all interaction through methods.
  - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the necessary parts. 
  For example, a user interacts with a `print()` function without knowing how the printer works internally.
  - **Inheritance**: Reusing code by deriving new classes from existing ones.
  - **Polymorphism**: Allowing objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling method 
  overriding and dynamic behavior.

- **Encapsulation vs Abstraction**:
  - **Encapsulation** is about *how* information is hidden (via access modifiers like `private`, `protected`).
  - **Abstraction** is about *what* information is hidden (via abstract classes or interfaces).

- **Virtual Functions & Diamond Problem**:
  - These are advanced OOP topics, especially relevant in languages like C++ and Java.
  - **Virtual functions** enable dynamic dispatch—deciding at runtime which method to invoke.
  - The **Diamond Problem** arises in multiple inheritance when two parent classes inherit from the same base class,
   and a child class inherits from both—leading to ambiguity. 
   Languages resolve this differently (e.g., C++ uses virtual inheritance; 
   Java avoids it by not allowing multiple class inheritance).

### 🌐 DOM (Document Object Model)

The interviewer also touched on **DOM**, highlighting its importance in **web development**:

- **DOM** is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the page so that programs can change the document 
structure, style, and content.
- It treats HTML or XML documents as a **tree structure**, where each node is an object representing a part of the page.
- Understanding DOM is crucial for tasks like:
  - Manipulating elements with JavaScript (`document.getElementById`, `querySelector`)
  - Handling events (`onclick`, `onchange`)
  - Dynamically updating content without reloading the page (e.g., AJAX)

### 🌐 Computer Networks
The interviewer explored **network topologies**, which are structural layouts of how devices (nodes) are connected in a network. The discussion likely included:

| Topology     | Advantages                              | Disadvantages                         |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Bus**      | Simple, cost-effective                   | Single point of failure, slow with traffic |
| **Star**     | Easy to manage, scalable                 | Hub failure brings down the network    |
| **Ring**     | Predictable performance, orderly data flow | One node failure affects entire ring   |
| **Mesh**     | High redundancy, fault-tolerant          | Expensive, complex setup               |

The mention of **network security aspects** suggests the interviewer also touched on:
- **Encryption protocols** (SSL/TLS)
- **Firewalls and intrusion detection**
- **Authentication mechanisms** (OAuth, Kerberos)

### 🗃️ SQL Fundamentals
The next segment focused on **relational database design**, specifically:

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each record in a table.
- **Foreign Key**: Establishes a link between two tables, enforcing referential integrity.

These are foundational for understanding **normalization**, **joins**, and **schema design**—critical for backend engineers working with structured data.

---

### 🧮 Core Data Structures
To round out the interview, the candidate was asked about:

- **Arrays**: Fixed-size, index-based storage.
- **Linked Lists**: Dynamic memory allocation, node-based structure.
- **Stacks vs Queues**:
  - **Stack**: LIFO (Last In, First Out), used in recursion, undo operations.
  - **Queue**: FIFO (First In, First Out), used in scheduling, buffering.

#### 💡 "We discussed the latest technology trends that had fascinated me..."
This reflects a personalized, open-ended discussion where the interviewer encouraged the candidate to share their curiosity—likely around areas like AI, blockchain, cloud computing, or fintech. The goal was to assess:
- Awareness of emerging technologies
- Ability to articulate why they matter
- Passion for innovation

#### 🔧 "I was asked what improvement would I like to bring in it?"
This question shifts from passive observation to **active ideation**. The interviewer wanted to see:
- Critical thinking: Can you spot limitations or inefficiencies?
- Creativity: Can you propose meaningful enhancements?
- Ownership: Do you think like a builder or a user?

#### 💳 "I was challenged to envision improvements in online payment systems like Paytm and Google Pay..."
This is a classic **product thinking** prompt. The interviewer likely expected:
- UX enhancements (e.g., faster onboarding, better fraud alerts)
- Security upgrades (e.g., biometric fallback, dynamic CVV)
- Infrastructure ideas (e.g., offline payments, cross-border support)

It tests your ability to **analyze existing systems**, identify pain points, and propose **scalable, user-centric solutions**.

#### 🔐 "Design a new Cryptographic Algorithm."
This is a bold challenge—less about writing actual cryptographic code and more about:
- Understanding encryption principles (e.g., symmetric vs asymmetric)
- Recognizing vulnerabilities (e.g., man-in-the-middle, brute force)
- Proposing novel ideas (e.g., hybrid schemes, quantum-resistant logic)

It’s a test of **conceptual depth**, **security awareness**, and **abstract thinking**—especially relevant for roles involving secure transactions or data protection.

### 💳 Improvements to Online Payment Systems (Paytm, Google Pay)

Here’s a strategic breakdown of enhancements you could propose:

#### 1. **Offline Payment Mode**
- **Problem**: No internet = no transaction.
- **Solution**: Use SMS-based fallback or NFC peer-to-peer mode with delayed sync.
- **Impact**: Enables payments in low-connectivity areas (rural, underground metros).

#### 2. **Dynamic Fraud Detection**
- **Problem**: Static rules miss evolving fraud patterns.
- **Solution**: Integrate real-time ML models that analyze transaction behavior (location, frequency, device fingerprint).
- **Impact**: Reduces false positives and improves security.

#### 3. **Unified Loyalty Wallet**
- **Problem**: Cashback, vouchers, and points are scattered.
- **Solution**: Create a unified wallet that auto-applies best rewards across merchants.
- **Impact**: Boosts user retention and merchant engagement.

#### 4. **Voice-Activated Payments**
- **Problem**: Accessibility for elderly or visually impaired users.
- **Solution**: Add voice interface with biometric confirmation.
- **Impact**: Inclusive design and broader adoption.

### 🔐 Designing a New Cryptographic Algorithm (Conceptual Sketch)

Let’s imagine a hybrid algorithm called **“QuantaLock”**—designed for post-quantum resilience and real-time IoT transactions.

#### 🔧 Core Features:
- **Hybrid Encryption**: Combines lattice-based cryptography (quantum-safe) with symmetric AES for speed.
- **Time-Bound Keys**: Keys expire after a short window (e.g., 30 seconds), reducing replay attack risk.
- **Multi-Factor Entropy**: Key generation uses device fingerprint + biometric hash + timestamp.
- **Lightweight Footprint**: Optimized for low-power devices (e.g., smartwatches, sensors).

#### 🔐 Example Use Case:
- A smart lock receives an encrypted unlock command.
- It validates the time-bound key, biometric hash, and device signature.
- If all match, it decrypts the command and unlocks.

This kind of algorithm would be ideal for **IoT ecosystems**, **secure mobile payments**, and **edge computing environments**.

## 📘 Normalization & Normal Forms

Normalization organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve integrity. Here are the key normal forms:

| Normal Form | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| **1NF**     | Atomic values; no repeating groups | `Student(Name, Phone1, Phone2)` → split into separate rows or columns |
| **2NF**     | 1NF + no partial dependency (only applies to composite keys) | `Course(StudentID, CourseID, CourseName)` → move `CourseName` to separate table |
| **3NF**     | 2NF + no transitive dependency | `Employee(ID, DeptID, DeptName)` → move `DeptName` to `Department` table |
| **BCNF**    | Stronger version of 3NF; every determinant is a candidate key | Fix anomalies where non-key attributes determine other non-key attributes |

## 🆚 MongoDB vs Traditional RDBMS

| Feature | MongoDB (NoSQL) | RDBMS (SQL) |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| Data Format | BSON (Binary JSON) | Tables with rows and columns |
| Schema | Flexible | Fixed schema |
| Scalability | Horizontal (sharding) | Vertical (scaling up) |
| Joins | Limited support | Strong relational joins |
| Use Case | Real-time apps, IoT, unstructured data | Banking, ERP, structured data |

### 🧪 Basic Queries

**SQL**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE age > 30;
```

**MongoDB**:
```js
db.customers.find({ age: { $gt: 30 } });
```

---

## 🧬 BSON in MongoDB

- **BSON** = Binary JSON
- Supports additional types like `Date`, `int`, `long`, `float`, `binary`
- Optimized for speed and traversal in MongoDB

---

## 🌐 RESTful Services & GCM

- **RESTful Services**: Stateless APIs using HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`)
- **GCM (Google Cloud Messaging)**: Deprecated, replaced by **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)**; used for push notifications in Android apps

## 🌲 Binary Tree Concepts

| Tree Type | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| **Complete Binary Tree** | All levels filled except possibly last, filled left to right |
| **Full Binary Tree** | Every node has 0 or 2 children |

### 🧮 Height of Full Binary Tree in O(1)

If `n` is the number of nodes in a full binary tree:
```cpp
int height = log2(n + 1);
```
This works because a full binary tree with height `h` has exactly `2^h - 1` nodes.

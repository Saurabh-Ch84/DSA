### üß® Explain Deadlock

A **deadlock** occurs in operating systems when two or more processes are stuck waiting for each other‚Äôs resources, and none can proceed. It‚Äôs like a circular traffic jam where every car waits for another to move.

**Four necessary conditions for deadlock**:
1. **Mutual Exclusion**: Only one process can use a resource at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait**: A process holds one resource and waits for another.
3. **No Preemption**: Resources can‚Äôt be forcibly taken away.
4. **Circular Wait**: A closed chain of processes exists, each waiting for a resource held by the next.

**Example**:  
Process A holds Resource 1 and waits for Resource 2, while Process B holds Resource 2 and waits for Resource 1 ‚Äî both are stuck.

### üîÑ Swap Two Numbers Without a Third Variable in Python

This is a classic Python trick. You can swap two variables using:

#### ‚úÖ Tuple Unpacking (Most Pythonic)
```python
x, y = 5, 7
x, y = y, x
```

#### ‚ûï Arithmetic Operations
```python
x = x + y
y = x - y
x = x - y
```

#### üîÄ Bitwise XOR (Efficient for Integers)
```python
x = x ^ y
y = x ^ y
x = x ^ y
```

Each method avoids using a third variable and demonstrates Python‚Äôs flexibility.

### üì¶ Difference Between Tuple and List in Python

| Feature           | List                          | Tuple                         |
|------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Mutability        | Mutable (can be changed)       | Immutable (cannot be changed) |
| Syntax            | Square brackets `[]`           | Parentheses `()`              |
| Performance       | Slower iteration               | Faster iteration              |
| Memory Usage      | More memory                    | Less memory                   |
| Built-in Methods  | Many (e.g., `append`, `remove`) | Few                           |
| Use Case          | Dynamic data                   | Fixed data                    |

**Example**:
```python
# List
a = [1, 2, 3]
a[0] = 10  # Allowed

# Tuple
b = (1, 2, 3)
b[0] = 10  # Error: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

Tuples are preferred when data shouldn‚Äôt change, while lists are ideal for dynamic collections.

### üîÑ What is AJAX?

**AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML)** is a technique that allows web pages to:
- Send and receive data from a server
- Update parts of the page dynamically
- Avoid full page reloads

It uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object or `fetch()` API in JavaScript to make background server calls.

---

### üöÄ Main Advantage of AJAX

The **key benefit** of AJAX is its ability to:
> ‚ÄúUpdate parts of a web page without reloading the entire page.‚Äù

This leads to:
- Faster interactions
- Reduced server load
- Improved user experience (e.g., live search, form validation).

---

### üìú What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a high-level, interpreted programming language used to:
- Add interactivity to web pages (e.g., animations, form validation)
- Manipulate HTML and CSS dynamically
- Handle events and asynchronous operations

It runs in the browser and powers most modern web applications. With tools like Node.js, it can also run on servers.
